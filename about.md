This site has been developed in an effort to take the confusion out of the ketogenic diet. It will largely use 'The Ketogenic Diet' by Lyle McDonald as a major source of content in its blog posts.

I am 34 years old, ~175kg and sick of being morbidly obese. The ketogenic diet seems to be quite successful for fat loss in particular as well as turning around the horrible out of control trainwreck that is insulin resitance.

Since about February 2017 I lost about 20kg using the ketogenic diet, after too many months of slacking off, I am ready to pick up where I left off and keep going!

I plan to curate a list of ketogenic recipes as well as some adaptations of some not-so-ketogenic meals also.

As I come across interesting publications I will be uploading notes and summaries about them as blog posts.
